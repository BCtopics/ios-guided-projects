class Song: NSManagedObject {

    // TEACHING NOTE: - Since Song is now a subclass of NSManagedObject, CoreData will call the initWithEntity:insertIntoManagedObjectContext: initializer when load from persistent store. However, subclasses don't automatically inherit their superclasses initializers unless explicitly overriden OR unless they don't have any main initializers of their own. A convenience initializer only counts as a backup initializer, so if it is all Song has, then Song inherits initializers from NSManagedObject
    convenience init?(name:String, artist: String, playlist: Playlist, context: NSManagedObjectContext = Stack.sharedStack.managedObjectContext) {
        
        guard let entity = NSEntityDescription.entity(forEntityName: "Song", in: context) else {return nil}
        
        self.init(entity: entity, insertInto:context)
        
        self.name = name
        self.artist = artist
        self.playlist = playlist
